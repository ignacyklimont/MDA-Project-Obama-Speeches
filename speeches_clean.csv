getting president well first question we  re going i  m whole lot reflecting think going policy we  re going better job think last two made series tough right moving country forward emergency situation risk slipping second great depression absolutely true stuff coming fast furious recovery package respect respect auto think people looking felt government getting much intrusive people  s accustomed reason emergency situation think it  s understandable said know maybe agenda opposed response emergency that  s something think everybody white house understood danger thought necessary i  m sympathetic said looking like potential overreach addition bunch price went even though emergency people rightly said gosh already debt already big potentially going compound point going get back situation we  re around country make sure spend something know pay opposed racking credit card next generation think thing election one think people excited campaign prospect would change business done hurry get done  t change got done think people i  m strong believer process congress  t people really want see comes making tough taxpayer spent rush get done sign bunch contrary think look said gosh like partisan squabbling like ways business one i  got take responsibility enough think opportunity move forward understanding eric cantor today said see moratorium that  s something think work together would still resist notion policy made president well think think absolutely true satisfied right percent unemployment instead percent unemployment people would confidence policy fact proof whether work economy gotten back needs  t job make sure i  m looking table comes job creation good job growth drive unemployment rate haven  t thought haven  t think chance working want try policy front think important thing say we  re going rule they  re democrat republican want see works ultimately i  president bottom line thank president health care you  re well aware obviously lot ran health care law law i  m wondering sir believe health care reform worked hard danger point whether there  s threat result election president well know there  s republican last night feel strongly i  m sure issue comes republican leadership said though think we  d election thought people want see us next two relitigate last two respect health care law generally may go raising know talk woman new  t mortgage house got cancer seeking treatment able get health insurance talk relieved child condition stay policy they  re old give time transition find job give health insurance small taking advantage tax provided say right thing improve health care system want suggest would deliver faster effective reform health care system wildly expensive many certainly federal government i  m happy consider know example know one that  s come provision health care bill burdensome small much much filing it  s probably designed make sure revenue raised help pay much trouble small find difficult manage something take look going think tweak make progress we  made true significant piece legislation think ask people stop trying close doughnut hole help senior get prescription go back situation people can  t get health insurance allow insurance drop coverage get sick even though you  paying think you  d strong vote people saying want eliminate according exit sir one two apparently said would like either see concerned may embolden party perhaps president well also one two think right thing obviously issue contentious said think going useful us go sort talking generally let  s talk particular provision comes something you  re you  re helping get prescription make sense take approach different mean governing think continue make progress find common ground thank president say anything else election spending say hell accept anything remotely like stimulus bill kind proposal stimulate job growth spending accept fact kind spending create dead point else government create number one issue president well think going important question think people absolutely concerned spending debt i  m going deficit commission forward it  s bipartisan group republican democratic congress hopefully able arrive consensus eliminate don  t work cut back government spending inefficient streamline government  t cutting core going make sure competitive economy growing providing opportunity come question think republican democratic going answer care that  s going tough debate tough already big deficit made worse recession bring want make sure we  re cutting education going help define whether compete around world don  t think cutting back research development develop new like clean energy could make difference job creation home think proposal

intelligent smart won  t undermining recovery fact encouraging job growth call wasteful spending say it  s dead arrival like without support can  t get president well absolutely true without republican support anything it  s going hard get done i  m going anticipate they  re going support anything think part message sent want see job growth country good people work traditionally

long it  s safe responsible don  t think anybody forgotten last year deal oil spill history know gulf coast haven  t forgotten learned disaster us put place safety responsibility example you  re going drill deepwater you  got prove start drilling actually contain underwater spill that  s common sense lately we  hearing saying well administration put oil operate offshore well yes spent time

budget surplus instead pay debt money spent new tax two expensive prescription drug program simply added nation  s credit card result deficit track top trillion year took office make worse recession meant less money coming us spend even  tax middle class spur economy unemployment insurance aid could prevent police laid emergency also added deficit every family little credit card debt manageable

spending level it  s since president let  s cut defense spending pentagon let  s cut waste fraud health care like time let  s make modest still future finally let  s ask biggest give tax code special balanced approach everyone give little without anyone sacrifice much would reduce deficit around trillion put us path pay debt  t happen abruptly they  d drag economy prevent us helping small middle class get back right approach also bipartisan many party  t happy painful enough willing accept burden fairly might like see revenue many senate said  yes i  m willing put politics aside consider approach care problem  credit kind approach republican speaker house working last several reason balanced approach  t way becoming law right significant number congress different approach approach  approach  t ask biggest contribute anything nothing top income scale approach would close deficit severe care  place greater burden working debate right  t whether need make

reduce interest raising revenue paying fair share would rather accept budget higher interest higher unemployment think know answer  those spoken today many house refuse consider kind balanced approach  approach president first president bush president many united senate we  re left stalemate today  s stalemate dangerous tied something known debt ceiling  term people outside probably never understand  raising debt ceiling allow congress spend money simply country ability pay congress already past raising debt ceiling routine since congress always every president president times w bush seven times next august else won  t able pay unfortunately past several republican house essentially said way they  vote prevent  s first ever default rest us agree deep spending approach default would enough money pay  include monthly social security  government we  first time history country  s credit rating would leaving around world wonder whether united still good bet interest would skyrocket credit car huge tax hike people would risk sparking deep economic crisis  one almost entirely reckless irresponsible outcome debate republican say agree must avoid default new approach speaker unveiled today would temporarily extend debt ceiling exchange spending would force us face threat default six  t solve problem first six month extension debt ceiling might enough avoid credit downgrade higher interest would pay result know reduce there  s point economy risk kicking road there  s even greater danger approach based we  seen past know expect six house refuse

solution ready credible solution congress either give authority raise debt ceiling exercise responsibility kept raise debt ceiling paying everybody mean complicated concept don  t go dinner eat want leave without paying check you  re breaking law congress think way people don  t congress debate maybe  t go dinner next time maybe go modest restaurant that  s fine that  s debate don  t say order control i  m going pay people already provided people already lent money that  s showing discipline that  s meeting can  t that  s credible way run government we  got stop crisis crisis crisis there  s clear path ahead us simply discipline responsibility compromise that  s need go that  s needs work thank president well know sir finding debt ceiling sometimes complicated member senate debt ceiling increase previous history president president walker bush president deficit reduction contingent upon context raising debt ceiling four times done three times related deficit reduction budget chuck think many people curious new adamant desire part negotiate conflict entire history modern era debt ceiling history debt ceiling  t suggest going go default situation one talking resolve president well major think look history getting debt ceiling always difficult town always difficult went last year what  s different never saw situation saw last year certain congress took absolutist position came within days fact matter never seen debt ceiling used fashion notion know might default unless get percent want  t i  m happy conversation reduce sensible way although one thing want point people also concerned grow economy put people back work make sure finance getting properly trained giving education deserve there  s whole growth agenda reduce that  s important well you  never seen notion far least deficit reduction we  count spending raise deficit debt ceiling dollar dollar spending whole set established impossible meet without severe damage economy we  re going put position order pay spending we  already two we  re either going profoundly hurt economy hurt middle class hurt hurt trying go college alternatively we  re going blow economy we  re going open one three month extension debt ceiling whatever congress you  re president whatever congress they  re going send something that  s sensible  t president  t one three month would united major can  t manage way pay provide certainty pay look don  t think anybody would consider position unreasonable presuppose need negotiate talk daily basis default biggest threat economy talk president major happy conversation reduce i  m going monthly every three conversation whether pay severe damage even threat default economy it  s hurting economy speak  t debate want conversation reduce deficit let  s we  last two entire campaign way people agreed reduce balanced way also account need us grow economy put people back work despite conversation despite election position that  s taken part house  no we  got way don  t simply won  t pay  s  well can  t position sustainable time it  s one good economy certainly going kind precedent want establish presidency future even side like voting debt ceiling republican president yet never saw situation somehow would go ahead default get percent way supposed work thank president issue given difficult would say impossible get gun control measure congress willing able presidency act without congress also like know make long seeing gun gun around country mean even since shooting president well understanding vice president going provide range take reduce gun violence require legislation accomplish executive action today said speak detail going go ahead propose later week confident take require legislation within authority president get step opportunity reduce possibility gun violence want go ahead take idea kind president well think example gathering data example fall track effectively may take administratively opposed legislation far people lining think seen time oppose common sense gun control gun safety pretty effective way ginning fear part gun somehow federal government take away probably economic element obviously good business think us look problem repeatedly said responsible gun people gun protection hunting sportsmanship anything worry issue whether believe second amendment issue sensible take make sure somebody like individual walk school gun bunch shockingly rapid fashion surely something part challenge confront even hint sensible responsible legislation area notion somehow comes everybody going taken away unfortunate case look first four administration we  tried tighten enforce already would pretty hard argue somehow gun think irrational fear driving people go stock president think irrational fear president well said think fear worried possibility legislation getting thank president want come back debt ceiling summer said negotiate debt ceiling last year said extend bush tax wealthy say going negotiate debt ceiling year house take seriously think get one minute midnight scenario going back president well first let take example year fiscal cliff say would extending bush tax said going extend bush tax wealthy argue campaign said set criteria wealthy ended fact matter paying significantly said start concern making sure tax code fair middle class biggest priority making sure middle class go difference year fact already made trillion time could sensibly make would damage economy would impede growth said time think pair revenue order overall balanced package budget reflected discretionary spending budget reflected made made challenge going forward made big going deficit reduction way balanced responsible way alternative us go ahead cut made like social security us fundamentally change made make sure go poverty disabled properly us change contract made people rather look like need long term trend fundamentally think people expect government sit negotiate compromise also reflect people one narrow faction able simply dictate percent want time otherwise threaten destroy economy another way got break habit crisis good time start second term continue path really stopping principle mean literally even divided government even got democratic president democratic senate small group house could simply say every two every three every six every year going change economy ways prefer despite strong across country otherwise going pay way us business way would make argument republican president republican senate handful suggesting going hijack process make sure either get way percent time otherwise going default  s line sand economy president look i  said i  m happy conversation deficit reduction technically willing negotiate president look pretty straightforward either congress want keep responsibility think come plan somehow criteria they  set raise debt ceiling free go ahead try they  put forward order accomplish cutting spending like education people profoundly reject think get congress free try think better way go ahead say we  re going pay question actually get deficit manageable sustainable way conversation i  m happy thank sir you  spoken extensively debt ceiling debate said willing allow government shutdown take place rather put deep spending prepared allow government grind halt disagree spending cut put forth think people would blame came pass president well ultimately congress whether spend money whether keep government open congress made decision want shut government order get way least house probably think would mistake think would profoundly economy think would actually add deficit impede growth think it  s shortsighted they  re put they  re going make decision don  t suspect people would blame able get act together issue we  re trying accomplish trying reduce deficit we  re trying reduce deficit shape bipartisan plan reduce deficit mean really objective concern we  re spending take that  s case there  s way balancing take money increasing revenue reduce spending there  s recipe getting done speaker end year came pretty close hundred billion separating us year period that  s lot what  s point house simply deficit reduction particular vision government suspicious government  s example make sure decent health care get older social security whether government make sure poverty getting enough eat whether spending money medical research they  got particular view government view people presidential campaign think every poll that  s people actually think commitment education really important that  s something look last resort reducing deficit lot sense us close example corporate go bigger burden house disagree want shut government see get way that  s prerogative that  s system set damage economy government big part economy it  s interesting lot times people recognize comes defense spending say we  got cut spending complain government don  t anything comes defense contractor district think wow pretty important part economy district  t stop spending let  s make sure we  re spending find agreement president look hope common sense that  s always preference think would preference people that  s would good economy let repeat issue deficit reduction getting sustainable time getting debt sustainable place congress partner achieve achieve fairly quickly mean know know needs done know balanced approach would take we  already done probably half deficit reduction need stabilize debt deficit there  s probably pain drama getting finishing job  t difficult everybody comes conversation open mind recognize like paying right i  m going take one last question thank president president i  d like ask you  end first term starting second couple one that  s another recent one become truism you  re staff insular don  t socialize enough second recent criticism team taking shape  t diverse  t diverse could even getting additional gender race ethnic diversity i  d like address president sure let take second one first i  m first four diverse diverse white house cabinet history intend continue turns look best people given incredible diversity country you  re going end diverse staff diverse team diversity create effective better decision making different table think first four person probably influence foreign policy woman people charge moving forward important domestic initiative health care person charge homeland security woman two supreme court percent white house staff think people expect record built upon next four i  made four far one admittedly high profile one leaving already left administration made replacement would suggest everybody kind wait they  seen who  s white house staff who  s cabinet rush judgment big three president yes guess i  m saying think you  seen overall team like it  s premature assume somehow we  re going backwards we  re going backwards we  re going forward respect  truism  enough back stuff people know know i  m pretty friendly guy like good party truth senate great point president accusation frequently think really what  s gone paralysis stark policy sharp stand think let say speaker like speaker personally went golf great time get deal done congressional picnic coming taking

opposition russia engaging going it  s going move us farther away rather towards ultimate solution looking president throughout process think people constantly easy low cost answer whether it  s sent early somehow everything would taken shot even give chemical immediately would folded regime would folded would suddenly seen peaceful hugely difficult complex problem would hoped would learned devoted enormous time effort best people given people people opportunity democracy it  s still hard saw week virtue lack effort part lack commitment we  still got still spending dollar supporting government it  s still tough make decision level military involvement prepared engage make judgment based start something we  got finish we  got well fact capacity make serious impact understanding we  still got go still support training military us still business push consistently last four five sought wide range take potentially move better direction incredible humanitarian catastrophe seeing traveling dangerous real political among allies heartbreaking trying escape war potential impact country allies region learned last unless get ground agree live together fashion amount u military engagement solve problem find either little bit making difference losing credibility way finding drawn situation sustain hear people offering half baked trying involved situation i  d like see people

there  s always crisis impulse always something it  s always right thing  would react governor bush president even think react one think people hear make based fact every couple mass shooting decide whether consider  stuff happening  i  team past scrub enforce place effectively keep additional take might prevent even handful tragic taking place said last night change politics change behavior main thing i  m going i  m going talk regular basis politicize inaction political decision making reason congress support even modest gun safety sandy hook majority people don  t support mean normally responsive electorate you  got majority people think it  s right thing background common sense would maybe save  t even get full vote it  s politics it  s interest fund feed people fear fairness it  s republican party although republican party uniformly opposed gun safety unless change political dynamic we  re going able make big dent problem example you  hear people talk problem it  s mental illness well talk people study problem true majority mass angry young men millions angry young men around world millions angry young men don  t shoot  t help us identify majority people mental can  t sort identify ahead time might take like thing make sure can  t entire arsenal something snaps we  re going something politics change politics change people intense

going happen overnight thank president go back opening said won  t sign another short term know yesterday secretary lew government  s borrowing authority would run around would recommend increase debt ceiling part budget spending also speaker  s race complicate president i  m sure speaker  s race rhetorical question complicate comes debt ceiling going back maybe it  s let refresh everybody

financial system kind saw back it  s bad thing going negotiate get done next five even though resolution keep government open get debt ceiling raised five got shorter timetable get done here  s bottom line nancy harry we  spoken trying negotiate budget agreement yes speaker  s decision step think still path us come reasonable agreement spending sequester make sure properly finance defense nondefense needs prudent control short order it  s complicated math math i  get work immediately push next several try leave extraneous may prevent us getting budget agreement know example many parenthood deeply disagree issue think it  s parenthood understand feel strongly respect issue like potentially wreck entire u economy hold entire budget hostage desire something gun violence feel strongly think i  got better evidence notion would threaten unless gun safety would stop mass i  m going shut government sign increase debt ceiling would irresponsible people rightly would reject well true fight individually want parenthood there  s way pass law override veto true across whole bunch disagree democracy works got problem govern i  m next speaker problem speaker department

 t always see they  re always communicating publicly you  re catching say publicly becomes challenge work every level make sure there  s slip information among we  re strengthen information foreign part tragedy think you  re seeing much greater different kind challenge sort organization like al involved highly trained working network essentially trying encourage induce somebody may prey kind propaganda becomes difficult see mean they  re less likely able carry large complex saw san obviously still enormous damage issue social media think may gotten little bit may it  s important distinguish public social media page versus private various social media law enforcement intelligence constantly public part visa review process people investigating said publicly maybe made private communication two that  s harder discern definition one we  engaging high tech community find appropriate way better job lead able track suspected terrorist we  re going recognize government going capacity read every single person  s text social media it  s posted publicly going feasibility probably insurmountable level mean keep mind couple ago major debate whether government becoming much like big brother overall think we  struck right balance protecting civil making sure u  privacy making sure there  s oversight intelligence we  re going continue balance needs security people  s legitimate privacy global communication global apply oftentimes trying come country also they  re precisely we  re working hard bring law enforcement intelligence high tech together we  re going really review technically well consistent order try discern rapidly potential may question thank president question congress made pretty clear they  re going let transfer united trial people think already executive authority transfer close next year question believe authority willing exercise close place president well first we  working systematically another example persistence reducing population review process eligible transfer locate accepted monitor it  s determined transferred expectation early next year reduced population continue steadily chip away there  s going come point irreducible population people pose significant threat various it  s difficult us try article court going military commission process there  s going challenge stage i  m plan congress close i  m going automatically assume congress i  m coy think it  s fair say there  s going significant resistance quarters think make strong argument  t make sense us spending extra million million million million billion secure setting people wait congress definitively said well thought plan attached say anything definitive executive authority think it  s far preferable get stuff done congress question president said think you  seen whole bunch like immigration i  m going forward leaning without congress i  tested congress every they  surprise may one think make really strong argument one key recruitment  s question propagandize convince somebody united may criminal record history terrorist activity start shooting part feed notion gross injustice living professed know see traffic see used create mythology war us close part strategy military diplomatic intelligence combine fact it  s really expensive essentially point handful people person costing several million detain efficient ways think make strong argument i  take point uphill battle every battle i  congress last five uphill keep surprising actually getting stuff done sometimes may prove necessary try get ahead question thank president ask middle east running president united would  t regime change like gone experience spring aftermath wonder see u role middle east trying push power would advise future call authoritarian step specifically point expectation  s presidency outlast president there  s lot revisionist history sometimes people making different depending situation maybe it  s useful us go back depose millions dissatisfaction corruption authoritarianism regime working relationship trigger spring notion somehow u position pull country world think mistaken true point choice becomes mowing millions people trying find transition would still argue sensible us find peaceful transition situation respect sort alternative version ways time international coalition chaos already broken already civil war dictator threatening position carry wholesale slaughter large people worked u n mandate coalition order try avert big humanitarian catastrophe would good us argue retrospect left seem forget already lost legitimacy control country could instead could another problem fact failure part entire international community think united accountability moving enough need rebuild government quickly consequence bad situation far goes think entirely right proper united speak behalf authoritarian leader killing people notion would stand say nothing contrary serve point us collusion kind governance would make us even target terrorist activity would question think government cope try stop president reason problem majority country lost space early execute inclusive transition peaceful transition chose instead slaughter people idea minority population could somehow crush millions people oppose feasible it  s plausible even cold eyed hard hearted human toll  t happen consequence view bring peace get end civil war unless government legitimate majority country happen argument i  repeatedly dating five ago time suggestion gather suggesting bad let brutal repressive least he  keep order said look problem history trying keep order large majority country turned good five later right opportunity kerry meeting speak turkey gulf interested opportunity turn back clock it  s going difficult completely overcome devastation that  s already find political transition state bunch inside hopefully initiate won  t perfect turn number one focus allies region going difficult process it  s going painstaking process that  s based idealism part that  s hard headed calculation what  s going get job done question think though potentially could remain power year president think going leave order country stop bloodletting involved able move forward non sectarian way lost legitimacy large majority country way us bridge political transition allied right ensure like crushed retribution order day think that  s going important well that  s difficult sadly made decision important personally entire country kind political transition would much easier it  s lot harder kerry excellent work moving process forward think you  seen recognition couple they  re really moving needle much despite sizeable deployment inside course that  s would happen there

number like wherever there  s opportunity i  m going take question thank president climate change already time deal said potentially turning point world deal legally binding document congress pretty much completely worried point republican president might take white house could stop deal entirely considering possibility interested democratic nominee considering danger president think it  s fair say going democratic nominee even without danger confident going terrific democratic nominee whose phone come somebody recognize ring don  t embarrassed turn go still hear think it  s think strong

serving country want talk well let start back teacher know taught constitutional law thinking supreme court thinking would make someone make someone great justice successful justice different spot thinking surprisingly much would obviously substantial argument right particular judge also process federal supreme court get way garland extraordinary jurist indisputably qualified serve highest court land nobody really otherwise want clear question excellence uniformly also legal current supreme court good judge country right he  s fair he  s smart he  s objective he  s consensus builder judicial restraint he  s appreciative unique role court also respectful role government one plausibly made argument kind person we  d want supreme court question becomes hard guy get hearing vote what  s generally comes process federal used people read constitution article fairly straightforwardly president shall make advice consent senate unless sort real problem judge  s character fairly routine every level district court level appellate court level supreme court person would confirmed short order would hearing people would ask potential judge question two five would satisfactorily process senate would vote understood president constitutional duty make appointment senate constitutional duty least make determination whether person bench unique process growing attitude inside senate every nomination matter well qualified judge subject contention it  s simply one party gum works drag confirmation longer longer even ultimately judge confirmed voice vote unanimous consent senate they  drag two three business done sometimes it  s strategic view despite talk people wanting objective calling bring bear litmus applied prevent judge getting fair vote even though qualified meet particular party problem got bad enough previous came head administration situation starting see six pass nine pass judge could get hearing charge senate particular filibuster previously used routinely everything  t get seeing crisis across everywhere finally said ending ability senate filibuster comes district court appellate court going preserve supreme court situation judge  s passing it  s republican majority senate intend vote highly qualified judge situation saying simply consider nomination going shut process consequence tie supreme court potentially least two supreme court vacancy remain unprecedented willing hold vote point hold judge garland said even show courtesy meeting judge find think what  s important understand going court potentially legal system democracy start getting situation process broken partisan eminently qualified jurist even get hearing going see sharp partisan polarization come characterize electoral politics entirely judicial system extension politics institutional integrity judicial branch point people lose confidence ability fairly adjudicate democracy afford system designed make sure branch works broad consensus even agree particular ruling court  s legitimate consistent democratic design important it  s matter ninth seat supreme court democracy operate particular authority court bring order democracy work really long answer long well let ask president get point hear sometimes problem supreme court political course politics supreme court controversial almost beginning  attack court way  impeach earl warren  country   haven  t explanation brought us position think variety first it  s important underscore said law even critical legal think reading acknowledge there  s politics legal make right wrong governing society extension political democratic conversation nobody right past decide balance liberty security treat minority assure majority rule make sure political process integrity count issue real people there  s nothing wrong think congress senate particular change think ways judicial process casualty democracy first politics become much there  s something  great  media works either watch fox news read new york times rarely get carry weight within party notion liberal republican conservative democrat broke politics got fed culture congress basic comity courtesy process institutional respect people agree break filibuster said becoming standard practice there  s nothing constitution every item comes senate supposed get super majority used filibuster  t distinguished history used principally blocking civil anti voting legislation bad enough suddenly norm everything minority decide block majority favor think breakdown process fairness blameless talk they  also often point nomination times used filibuster block republican conservative legal eminently qualified say circumstance republican president  s appointee get hearing get vote general proposition confirmed even strong think circumstance senate decided base important constitutional institutional democracy way dangerous judicial nomination process think become extreme example let take back step thinking making appointment going try put historical context little bit really set reshape court franklin may example determined find would uphold new deal legislation would limit people accused sort one model particular agenda think president example three great century chief justice warren justice justice came different identifiable tendency way thought constitution see one something different there  s doubt making justice matter mean they  d rule particular issue fact careful interview ask particular case controversy might make seem want particular outcome consistently looking saw justice saw justice people number one intellectual integrity look law even uncomfortable like outcome follow law recognize job number two bring humanity job mean particularly supreme court nine well certainly federal nine probably arrive outcome basic constitutional interpretation there  s going lot controversy really matter there  s ambiguity there  s lack clarity constitutional applied way true precedent true basic legal also unique role court making sure people locked political process example permanently locked recourse understand world works entirely blind history racial discrimination gender discrimination money world necessarily rule particular issue they  re looking tough case statute constitution provide immediate ready answer apply judgment grounded actually live made extraordinary country want lived little able see wide spectrum people they  re going enormous power lot times talk judiciary spend time growing formative ways anything part reason think garland would extraordinary judge he  s already extraordinary judge think life story introduction high school class valedictorian he  s got student speaking ahead war trying unplug guy  s comes necessarily student impromptu vigorous defense free speech year old something confidence somebody who  s thought core ethics society hear work city he  s investigation justice department fact meticulous investigation  t cut even though wake terrorist oftentimes convenient people going call cut time kept program mourning deceased memorial knew one people one affected profound ways something much anything think going give confidence kind person judge want make sure got somebody who  s wise people arbitrary provide confidence justice system also think part reason thought ideal precisely polarization talking good moment us somebody sides chief justice appellate court consistently said despite opposite bunch said somebody wrong you  got think long hard want see prudence let sort pick mean know people left disappointed choice chief judge garland thought someone would aggressive moving court certain direction guess want say us knew  back then  could said  t remember correctly correct teaching constitutional law people line work hold warren court model say court  s job really front society  s remember correctly skeptical law professor right skepticism carried think right adage con law familiar probably terrific shield they  re always effective sword mean history brown v board education best example end spectrum decision like antithetical want see court certain like brown democracy broken fundamental way majority shut access redress minority group times individual engaging let  s say highly unpopular speech going able political process uphold collectively decided pretty important uphold progressive view operate think judge garland said federal judge  t mean broad writ simply remake society ideally you  got political process argue elect

growing interest movement criminal justice reform it  s bipartisan it  s sincere part sides it  s interest convergence fiscal seeing expensive incarcerate people year year year it  s breaking bank particularly state level track spending public education spending incarceration last almost direct line people jail less support public example there  s fiscal concern got libertarian strand really believe government  s business somebody taking smoking pot let  s say would want jail got sincere evangelical movement oftentimes involved prison idea second chance combine law enforcement think

VOX Live Interview at the Blair House,06 Jan 2017,ck authenticity certified text version directly audio good morning great thank much good important issue get expectation among many staff many congressional affordable care act rolled millions people would become popular would safe repeal even substantial reform point  t seem quite true think theory got wrong  t health care law become popular well let  s back say start there  s reason hundred president could get expansion health care coverage beyond work done primarily reason hard health care system big personal think recognize need health insurance something think except go wrong accident sick particularly time feeling economically added higher higher real challenge getting always fact unlike advanced  t start system everybody covered complicated third party meant even got law anything dissatisfied people health care system could quote unquote   even nothing something even trying get law thing fact unwillingness congress around country fight say right let  s try make work way time president bush tried expand prescription drug program part meant public never originally opposed concession know actually good affecting public opinion third thing whenever look say something percent supportive law something percent dissatisfied dissatisfied column whole bunch sanders single payer plan problem think failure problem think went far enough left many people still uncovered people getting  t rich there  s way dealing prescription drug way meant even law going still lot tough politics said thing fact gotten million people covered able reduce pace health care going ever since law basically health care inflation low saved federal government extended trust fund importantly people gotten insurance there  s pretty high satisfaction shown rather look public opinion whole thing interested affecting people gotten real gotten real coverage get every single day people say saved life saved bank account made sure son got hooked sort able get treatment able get caught cancer time ultimately measure success law think dynamic reform health care system goes way beginning repeal delay strategy president elect trump said want repeal also replace something many people said least certain think dynamic responsible people  t like going hamper republican movement change system maybe don  t like lot people well let start simple premise works i  m something cover make sure condition still get coverage make sure prescription affordable encourage preventive keep people healthy sure rural people access substance abuse care mental health care continue function effectively better quality it  s terrific i  m think part challenge whole debate true dating back back idea somehow fixed way trying fix health care system rigid stubborn  t welcome republican great fact look law i  said publicly starting scratch probably would single payer system it  s easier people understand manage that  s essentially single payer system people certain age people satisfied it  s complicated understand access  t available  t starting scratch said well system providing coverage everybody politically could actually get congress could get republican support lo behold plan designed bipartisan basis republican governor ultimately nominee republican party came close providing universal coverage would thought since idea previously gotten lot republican support would continue get lot republican support yet somehow magically minute said great idea it  s working said terrible don  t want say simply make something clear start made clear could show would work better thought would happy incorporate law rather offer got big don  t want law last six seven argument provide great replacement much better everybody affordable care act providing yet last six seven actual replacement law credible health care policy said would work better fact many would result millions people losing coverage coverage worse kept time think go ahead show fact program would genuinely work better want call whatever want call call actually works first one say great told back suspect happen reason happen want provide coverage people certain got number one health care cheap people afford health care don  t get job government got pay money number two say want keep like example making sure people get health care even condition well turns way meet guarantee either make sure everybody modest obligation get health care gaming system got willing provide huge insurance taking people already sick think going see republican president elect control congress made better everybody going satisfied going really hard meet strategy repeal first replace later huge disservice people something think whether republican democrat opposed real stake getting right people say son daughter insurance ability get lifesaving ability get drug treatment ability get mental health entirely dependent us able afford keep insurance fact going massive undoing one sixth economy need put forward specific going people need able debate need able study way affordable care act let people gauge going result something better produced convinced better  t afraid make presentation really interesting try figure trying rush repeal quick afraid  t want say plan show side side plan better produced said absolutely better saying every republican right fact put plan together demonstrably better publicly support plan want see first want see first want third party objective people whether congressional budget office health care across ideological spectrum whoever evaluate public take word designate show better effective provide better coverage  t  t idea somehow oh legacy keep mind one personalize feed antipathy towards party tool politics don  t pride authorship thing come something better show would advise every democrat show better much ask challenge question right feel obliged repeal show going replace majority clear think bad idea republican republican said don  t think good idea real explanation would actually try new president even exactly rush particularly going delay actual repeal making argument disastrous actually think repeal completely today terrible well would disagree least could understand saying going vote repeal going delay effects couple well bad answer well would disruptive want take people  s insurance away right away well time show us importantly show people need health insurance exactly sense know long answer sense answer yes health care system choose repeal something providing health insurance lot people providing every health insurance even they  re getting job shown us they  re going irresponsible even party even opposed said irresponsible thing let follow little bit congressional fight saw yesterday president elect trump said yesterday twitter  it time get together come health care plan really works  something remember saying similar covering debate knowing know partisanship president tried like said unable get republican three advice would give someone trying attempt pass bipartisan health care law well look think sort gave advice fact politics providing best possible health care system people advice would say precisely think  t work you  already said think work keep saying well want keep people like working well think good idea stay health insurance plan they  re think good idea think good idea you  got condition still get health insurance assume think good idea gotten prescription closed doughnut hole course approve made encourage health care system quality rather number involved pay could make list terrible actually think works according right well let  s make list like people concerned well know people would always like lower pocket although affordable care act lot lot people afford health insurance absolutely true would love see even higher relieve even money also know seen implementation affordable care act certain particularly rural less densely seeing many there  s much competition well one way could solve problem say fact enough drive competition reduce give people enough public option available look people affordable care act big high they  d like many they  d like happy provide sign republican plan said going give people make even going public option option here  s problem think thing want guess point possible people goodwill try come significant law already require specific think needs far advice president elect fact met hour half right got said make team make republican congress come show actually make work better people they  re convincing think would find lot would prepared support far least what  s think exposed interesting tension system economic pain law come budget part ways done higher people higher couple  t change excise tax high value insurance come play individual mandate individual people keep usage health care keep cost health care make health care feel expensive make health care feel unusable think affordable care act got balance right system wide versus insulating health well let make couple first part beginning teasing said like serious policy detail basically put here  s insurance package offering choose variety different you  chosen figure qualified give sense pocket discovered lot early done look people health insurance like people everything else like get best deal price health care tricky buy kind see picture like health insurance tempting initially buy thing heaven forbid get sick turns gosh see doctor want specialist want inconvenient ended happening people bought oftentimes insurance could insurance wanting get much market share possible ended low cost going health insurance generally even buy health insurance think seeing making saying need charge something good news may might kind one time thing position able evaluation gotten balance right say get health care free going pay one way another either government going pay people many pocket fashion higher somebody going pay pocket one way another true either pay really good health care package something employer  s bottom line they  re onto form higher higher think lot good work done lowering cost shifting actually making system work better done lot work system instead five getting test system going get person healthy returned hospital well turns time real cost reduction system consequence kind stuff less going see cost shifting intention never say let  s make expensive people get health care they  re going access system think proof even though per person gone lot overall spending health care gone people come system want people use health care system want use emergency room want use stay healthy smoking cessation making sure they  re getting regular ultimately going save us much money wonky follow question highest health care world united regulate much charge emergency room visit appendectomy like really core tension fact high go doctor pay lot go doctor something health care law tackle curious hear reflect would think role price medicine well look irony whole debate people dissatisfied affordable care act essentially government control less pointing stir dissatisfaction comes right what  s solution answer less government regulation charge even whatever want work think system market based system health care system innovative prescription probably best example true essentially come new country drug fat wealthy enough invest research development make bigger plow back drug development essentially lot free system negotiate drug force much lower generally drug industry new true example probably want balance maintain innovation around system whole trying use place since there  s health care provider stakeholder health care industry  t ways want get business trying use lever get better better also people throughout system said irony tried people resistant republican congress us least telling people want lower various want control reason health care exactly like like flat screen sick sick time position negotiate right walk store say well going see get better deal trying figure like got meningitis four old make child better worry later mentality people comes health care traditional work perfectly health care system increase competition make work better ultimately want really get expensive regulation certain currently recently took trip area slightly different topic saw huge coverage gains health care law also overwhelmingly president elect trump one people met who  s us today enrollment worker thousand people coverage president elect trump improve affordable care act would like ask question hello president excited meet thanks little bit nervous see enrolled numerous first time working affordable care act also going people recently found area increase  t even taking many looking affordable care unaffordable unusable opportunity ask probably went think fix start think well first want thank people that  s hugely important second point would make place really worked it  s worked two one expanded haven  t lot big chunk making accessible people expanded seen much bigger drop uninsured  t way  t  t politics i  blunt federal government going pay expansion uncompensated care ended making money providing health insurance people hard bargain hard deal turn yet got number turned mainly republican republican state  t want make work beshear one people expand really active program don  t poll well  t call connect connect right whole lot people said well don  t like like program we  right people  t tell time it  s actually worked right true though true governor ran explicitly idea rolling back even though working state state exchange shift everything onto federal exchange people got lack interest effort part making thing work roll back realizing  t good politics thought running  t done also true main criticism affordable care act  t high probably lot working people don  t qualify don  t pay part coverage instead you  re health insurance you  re working person don  t lot money particularly older use health care system need better benefit package somebody might still high said country handful don  t lot competition looking they  re saying we  re going make lot money don  t end lot insurance two could would really make work even better people would number one provide working hard every day still find even hard meet public option they  re getting lot competition  t coming problem senator instead gather going repeal law going come something except taken away way pay working people taxing little bit higher cut money would gone right away going promise people better health care except going money pay nobody yet going work think back point made fact people fully satisfied getting hopeful something better least pressure congress say show us exactly deal going us take away deal got people sign may happy like tell wrong like better insurance  t even insurance people  t insurance get say first time life bad hip pain free first time finally got insurance answer insurance go back system got buy going buy even less subsidy got low time got stuff well schedule happy keep long like well couple want make don  t ask one thing haven  t touched yet much detail delivery system follow big part law policy experiment change space one maybe you  d hoped know think good example something worked better least worked well issue hospital turns lot times go hospital let say get appendix taken go home complication go back hospital obviously inconvenient expensive system whole turns help reduce people first making sure first procedure goes well secondly making sure good follow might hospital health care system go home getting phone remind take medicine got take make sure heal properly may done study turns people forget supposed don  t follow exactly doctor afford nurse house well maybe done help make sure supposed way don  t seen significant reduction hospital course law smart saying reimburse give benefit smart follow area think made real progress place connected think got good bipartisan support encouraging shifting fee service get procedure may end getting five instead getting one test five treating see real movement say system whole going pay patient well helpful think haven  t seen much improvement like probably one thing comes mind electronic medical think wired plugged everybody mean basically everything phone fact still don  t understand still get sent house nobody still input stuff spending time administrative work put big slug money trying encourage everybody digitalize catch rest world proven harder partly everybody different don  t talk people use effectively optimistic time inevitable going get better every part become lot would fact said everybody different sort economic pushing making system work better example service people make money keeping people medical making easier everybody access medical could lose business turned little complicated one thing interested kind see role debate gearing well let make couple number one think important remember people law much complicated process repeal law think campaign trail republican way process going work rushed vote taking place week next week quote unquote repeal really resolution congress start actually drafting law specifically would say make decision going replace long going take process think whether originally  t whether like don  t one thing would ask people adopt
